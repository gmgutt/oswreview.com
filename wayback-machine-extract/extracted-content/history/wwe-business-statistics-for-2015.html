<p>Total Revenue for 2015 was $658,800,000, a new company record, with OIBDA of $61,600,000 and total profit of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>$24,100,000.</strong></span></p>
<p>Total Dividend payments for the year were $36.33 million, so the company did not gross enough to cover the dividend, and used the cash on hand to cover the payments, effectively meaning that real losses this year were <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>$12.2 million.<br></strong></span> As a result, cash on hand fell to $102.4 million, down from $115.4 million on 12/31/2014. Cash on hand, which is partially obscured by a $50 million advance payment for international TV rights last year that was not allocated and simply added to the cash, has declined by $50 million in the last 3 years.</p>
<p>Before the launch of WWE Network, and expenditure required for its preparation, the company was averaging profit of $50 million annually.</p>
<p>The revenue was up $116.2 million from 2014, of which $54.4 million was due to the increase in TV Rights, and $44.4 million was from the WWE Network.</p>
<p>The company actually lost money in Q4 of 2015, reporting a total loss of $1.2 million. This was mostly due to an abandoned media center expansion project, which cost $7.1 million, and a $4.1 million for a management incentive compensation.</p>
<p>North America accounted for 75% of total revenues, down from 78.5% in 2014. Europe/Middle East/Africa increased from 12.7% to 17%.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">See: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2439&amp;catid=55&amp;Itemid=5365">WWF/WWE Reported Profit and Loss</a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>COMPANY VALUE/STOCK<br></strong></span></p>
<p>As of close of business on Friday 12th Feb, the company was worth approximately $1.11 billion.</p>
<p>The stock price, after the reports were issued, dropped from 15.75 at close on Wednesday, to 14.94 at close on Thursday. There was a further drop on Friday to 14.65, which is the lowest mark of 2016 so far, and the lowest since June 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WWE NETWORK</strong></span></p>
<p>Total Network revenue for 2015 was $138.8 million, with OIBDA of $48.4 million (The OIBDA includes PPV). The revenue number is based on the full $9.99 price, of which the company actually has to share with its partners and does not keep the full amount (The split is usually around 70/30 in favor of WWE), so the revenue total is a misleading stat.</p>
<p>The total number of subscribers as of 31st December 2015 was 1,272,000.</p>
<p>This number is broken down into 1,217,100 paid (939,900 domestic) and 54,900 on a free trial.</p>
<p>The final quarter of the year averaged 1,237,000 paid subscribers, which indicates that the number increased in October for the Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar HIAC match, but gradually decreased for the remainder of the quarter. Considering the line-ups for both Survivor Series and TLC, this decrease is not a major surprise.</p>
<p>There were 389,000 new sign-ups for Q4 2015, with around 405,000 cancellations. In total, 2015 had 1,973,800 new subscribers and 1,572,700 cancellations.</p>
<p>For the year, the total paid subscribers increased by 49%, as the total paid number on December 31st 2014 was 816,000. An increase was expected due to availability in international markets, so a more accurate indicator might be the domestic number, which increased 21.77%. How close this is to an accurate indication of domestic growth is impossible to say, as some of 772,000 domestic subscribers on 12/31/2014 would have unquestionably been international customers, who switched once the Network was available in their home country, so the real domestic increase would have been higher. As a comparison, NJPW World grew 75% between 01/04/2015 and 01/04/2016.</p>
<p>With the Royal Rumble and the launch in a few new international markets in January 2016 (Germany, Japan, Austria, Switzerland), the number should have increased in the first month of this year, although if the increase had been anything significant, the company probably would have released that number already.</p>
<p>In total, around 2.5 million people have subscribed to the WWE Network since the launch</p>
<p>The company plans to release an updated subscriber number on 04/04/2016 after Wrestlemania 32, and is forecasting an average paid subscriber level of 1,280,000 for Q1 2016.</p>
<p>Total viewing by subscriber is around 15.6 hours per month. 20% of total viewing time is for the monthly PPV, 30% of total viewing time is on original content, and 50% of total viewing time is spent on the back catalogue.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LIVE EVENTS</strong></span></p>
<p>Live Events for 2015 grossed $122.4 million, with 76% of this gross from domestic events. These numbers generally exclude NXT events, but do include the NXT tour of the UK.</p>
<p>Total Live Attendance was 2,055,000, averaging 6,000 domestically and 7,300 internationally. Live attendance was flat domestically when compared against 2014, but increased 18% internationally, although due to a 14% decline in ticket prices, gates only increased by 10%.</p>
<p>No official CMLL numbers are available, although the promotion would have attracted the second largest total attendance figure for the calendar year, with total paid somewhere between 500,000 and 750,000. NJPW had total paid attendance of 335,779 for 2015, averaging 1,777 paid and $175,000 per show. NJPW&rsquo;s previous financial year (which ended on Jul 31st 2015) had grossed $28 million approximately, with $3 million in total profit. AAA and Dragon Gate would have been the only other promotions in the world to exceed a legitimate total paid attendance of 150,000.</p>
<p>Officially, each live event cost an average of $263,526, with OIBDA of $115,502, although these numbers are slightly skewed by Wrestlemania and International shows. The average domestic show probably cost in the area of $230,000, and made a profit of $75,000.</p>
<p>Total OIBDA was $38 million, up 37% on 2015. The increase was mostly due to 11 extra events, and a 9% increase in domestic ticket prices.</p>
<p>Only 5 shows drew in excess of 15,000 fans for the year, with Seth Rollins, John Cena, Roman Reigns, Bray Wyatt and Dean Ambrose being the top full-time draws for the promotion.</p>
<p>Live Events accounted for almost 19% of the company&#8217;s total revenue, and around 16% of the total OIBDA (not including corporate &amp; other expenses).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MERCHANDISE</strong></span></p>
<p>Total Merchandise Sales for the year were $49.5 million, with 55% of sales coming from WWEShop online. Merchandise at live events increased 16%, with an average spend of $10.54 per fan (an increase of 10% from 2014).</p>
<p>WWE Shop had approximately 590,000 orders, up from 435,000 in 2014. Average order value decreased from $47.56 to $45.87.</p>
<p>Total OIBDA for the category was $14 million, up 25% from last year.</p>
<p>Total merchandise revenue was a new company record.</p>
<p>Merchandise accounted for 7.5% of the total company revenue, and around 6% of total OIBDA (not including corporate &amp; other expenses).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">See: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2444&amp;catid=55&amp;Itemid=6572">WWE Merchandise Financial Summary</a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TELEVISION</strong></span></p>
<p>TV Rights Revenue increased by 31% to $231.1 million, with OIBDA of $97 million (up 57%). The total increase of $54.4 million was primarily due to a $42.8 million increase in rights fees of existing programming. Around $10 million was from Tough Enough, of which USA Network appeared to pay in the region of $1 million an episode for.</p>
<p>TV Rights were the most profitable division in the company, accounting for almost 42% of the total OIBDA (not including corporate and miscellaneous), and 35% of the total company revenue.</p>
<p>For the year (including DVR), Raw averaged a 3.2 rating (down 6%), Smackdown averaged a 2.1 rating (down 10%), and Total Divas averaged a 1.4 rating (up 9%).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PPV</strong></span></p>
<p>PPV Revenue decreased 54% to $20.6 million. There were 1,403,000 buys in 2015, down from 2,292,000 in 2014 and 3,838,000 in 2013.</p>
<p>No numbers were revealed for TLC 2015, but preliminary indications are that it did the second lowest total of the year (after Fast Lane) and was in the region of 60,000 buys. Domestically, it apparently set a record low of 14,000. The company should release the actual confirmed numbers shortly. Individual breakdowns are available at the link below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">See: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3048&amp;catid=55&amp;Itemid=6562">WWE PPV Statistics 2015</a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WWE STUDIOS<br></strong></span></p>
<p>WWE has not released detailed information on WWE Studios performance, but total revenue for the year was $7.1 million, down 35% from $10.9 million in 2014. $4.6 million in revenue has been received from the six releases in 2015. Total assets are estimated at $26.353 million.</p>
<p>OIBDA decreased to a loss of $1,500,000, and there was $500,000 in impairment charges. OIBDA in 2014 was $500,000.</p>
<p>Since inception, WWE Studios has grossed $125.1 million, with a loss of $33.1 million (OIBDA).</p>
<p>The 2015 releases were: Vendetta (The Big Show), 12 Rounds 3 (Dean Ambrose), The Condemned 2 (Randy Orton), The Marine 4 (The Miz and Summer Rae), The Flintstones &amp; WWE, and Santa&#8217;s Little Helper. The first 3 had a limited theatrical release, with Marine and Flintstones being direct to DVD, and Santa&#8217;s Little Helper being primarily a TV film for the USA Network.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t have WWE profits from these movies yet, but we have sales information for 4 of the 6 films. Both 12 Rounds 3 and The Condemned 2 were complete bombs.</p>
<p><strong>The Flinstones</strong> (released in March) has grossed a total of $1,500,061, This includes around 87,000 DVDs sold for $1,388,271. As a comparison, the Scooby Doo film grossed a total of $4,810,533 in sales.</p>
<p><strong>The Marine 4</strong> (released in April) has grossed a total of $1,494,804. This includes around 100,000 units on DVD for a total gross of $1,201,106, and almost 20,000 units on BRD for a total of $293,698. As a comparison, Marine 3 grossed a total of $3,369,863 in sales.</p>
<p><strong>Santa&#8217;s Little Helper (The Miz and Paige)</strong> grossed $494,557 in sales, although the majority in revenue will come from TV Rights, so this film will be profitable, meaning that The Miz continues his streak of starring in profitable movies.</p>
<p><strong>Vendetta</strong>, released on 6/12, and in August on DVD, grossed a total of $973,501 to date on Home Video (10% Blu Ray). Around 70,000 units have been sold on DVD for $885,931.</p>
<p>Subject to change, and including distribution-only films, there are 8 movies (including a Scooby Doo sequel) on the calendar for next year.</p>
