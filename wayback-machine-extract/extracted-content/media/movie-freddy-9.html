<p><strong>Pre-Amble :</strong> Freddy Krueger is a horror icon. Initially intended to be a cash-in on the slasher flicks of the early 80s, it became a unique blend of darkly comic and horror with a great premise &#8211; the monster is the ghost of a murdered paedophile who kills children/young adults in their sleep &#8211; a terrifying notion. He stalks his victims by blending reality and a horrific fantasy before killing them, which is an incredible premise for a horror film. Fast-forward to 2010. Ahh, Rorschach as Freddy Kruger? Sign me up! The film had generally unfavourable reviews so I was aware that it wasn&#8217;t warmly received, which usually means I look to enjoy the film more and try to look for the positives. This film marks the first time Freddy has not been portrayed by Robert Englund (after 8 Elm St. movies including Freddy vs Jason).</p>
<p><strong>Cast/Crew :</strong> Directed by Samual Bayer, best known for directing rock concert DVDs. Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach from the Watchmen) plays Freddy Krueger in a decent performance, but his character has no charisma so&#8230;Thomas Dekker (John Connor from the Sarah Connor Chronicles) plays the brooding angsty teen heart-throb. No thanks! A niggling point, but all the teens are played by mid-20s actors. Kris (Katie Cassidy) is not believable as a high-school student in the least.</p>
<p><strong>Plot :</strong> Kris sees a burnt man in her diner, and watches in horror as he cuts her boyfriend (Dean)&#8217;s throat. That was a dream! In reality Dean is shown killing himself the same way. Kris believes this burnt man is responsible, and must uncover the truth while not falling asleep herself.</p>
<p><b>Good points : </b><br>
• Freddy looks cool, and he&#8217;s kept strictly as a heel (i.e. no rapping or cheesy one-liners that&#8217;d warm you to him)<br>
• The victims are more likeable than your typical douchebag disposable American teens.<br>
• There is an interesting swerve with the victims that I appreciated. (Highlight to reveal) Spoiler: <span style="color: #ffffff;">They kill off the protagonists at the start, so you follow other victims.</span>.<br>
• There&#8217;s two cool special effects bits: the landing turning into a blood pool, and it exploding through to the bedroom.<br>
• They go through Freddy&#8217;s back story, which is the most interesting (although curtailed) part of the film.<br>
• The score sounds like &#8220;The Ring&#8221; without the main song, which isn&#8217;t bad.</p>
<p><b>Bad points :</b><br>
• The film overly relies on shock-horror, not actual scares or atmosphere. Get ready for 20 &#8220;Boo!&#8221; moments; they&#8217;re pretty hackneyed, some of them are painfully obvious and become a chore.<br>
• No atmosphere, no suspense is built. Shock-horror can be effective if you build atmosphere. There&#8217;s none. They go for the &#8220;Boo!&#8221; immediately.<br>
• They miss the entire hook of the franchise &#8211; The whole genius of the Freddy scenario is that his victims don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re asleep or not &#8211; Freddy intentionally melds the dream and real world in the victim&#8217;s mind. This is thrown out the window because they have a f**king visual cue &#8211; green/orange lights flicker, telling you the victim is dreaming. Not impressed at all. Way to kill the suspense.<br>
• Apart from the two instances previously mentioned, the special effects are pretty meh. (Freddy coming through the bedroom wallpaper looked particularly cheap)<br>
• It&#8217;s not explained how Freddy came back in general, or how he can &#8216;exorcist&#8217; throw people around the room in the real world. Not even an attempt! C&#8217;mon, one line!<br>
• It&#8217;s a small point, but all of Freddy&#8217;s lines sound voiced over; i.e. they were re-recorded in post production. I&#8217;m sure it was to give it more emphasis, but it took me out of the moment constantly.<br>
• It would&#8217;ve been nice to have more interaction/payoff with Freddy&#8217;s killer(s) expounding on what they did ~15 years ago. I&#8217;m a fan of backstory.</p>
<p><strong>Overall : T</strong><b>his film has very little redeeming qualities. It defines a cash-grab on a famous franchise. It&#8217;s such a wasted opportunity, with today&#8217;s special effects and Freddy&#8217;s amazing gimmick. There&#8217;s a BLOODY VISUAL CUE to tell us if we&#8217;re in dream land or reality, ruining any suspense! Freddy deserves and can do better. Avoid.</b></p>
