<p><strong>Plot:</strong> A zombie outbreak occurs in several cities around the world. It&#8217;s somehow up to Brad Pitt to save the world.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>• This is an adaption from Max Brooks&#8217; book of the same name &#8211; which is absolutely nothing like it, aside from a worldwide zombie apocalypse happening. The book is written after the apocalypse, a collection of passages written by many different people describing the effect on society, politics, religion etc.<br>
• This big-budget action-horror was produced by Brad Pitt&#8217;s film studio and stars himself. He beat out DiCaprio&#8217;s company in the bidding. It&#8217;s release was delayed; the script was finished by different writers and ended up costing $190 million.<br>
• Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN investigator that travels around the world to meet various people, and uncover the source of the infection (ie the exposition). Why him and not someone more qualified, I don&#8217;t know. I also don&#8217;t know why he couldn&#8217;t just ring these people.<br>
• He&#8217;s forced into finding Patient Zero/a solution as his family are used as leverage. He rings them between locations &#8211; it&#8217;s shit and only slows down the plot. The forced &#8220;they&#8217;ve been moved to a less safer place&#8221; plot device turns out be garbage.<br>
• World War Z felt like it was missing some parts but it was edited well enough to be a whole story. (Did Pitt&#8217;s daughter having an asthma attack add anything? Alternate stories include the wife consenting to sex with Matthew Fox&#8217;s character, the helicopter para jumper, which is why a big actor seemingly only had 5 lines of dialogue. There was also no Airplane zombie scene &#8211; Pitt lands in Russia, is forced into the Russian zombie clearing squad, gets a call from Fox and makes he way back to America for his wife; leaving the film open for a supposed trilogy.)<br>
• 3D is superfluous. It must be post-converted (i.e. the crap kind), as it&#8217;s not shot to add anything specifically for 3D, just a higher ticket price.<br>
• Zombies are like 28 Days later: rabid, fast running and smart enough. It&#8217;s a high budget film but the tech just isn&#8217;t (wasn&#8217;t?) there to make masses of zombies look good &#8211; they run in packs and the CG is very &#8216;watery&#8217; making the mass of zombies &#8216;flow&#8217; down streets.<br>
• Resi Remake Rules: shooting them slows them down, in the head stops them, gotta burn the bodies to completely kill them. Nice.<br>
• Best line is Pitt being shown an axe and a baseball bat, and told &#8220;there are merits to each&#8221;. This is a reference to Max Brooks&#8217; prior book, the Zombie Survival Guide (which is great btw)<br>
• Morality trope: the family that took them in high-tail it without them, and get attacked by zombies.<br>
• In Israel, they&#8217;ve built a massive wall for safety (like the Chinese and the Goddamn Mongolians!) Here we see the big set piece from the trailer, thousands of zombies pile-on to climb the wall and get the humans. Great stuff! Really impressive co-ordination from the undead.<br>
• We see if immediate amputation can counteract being bit.<br>
• Another fun set-piece, they get on a plane, you&#8217;d never guess what&#8217;s in the toilet! Also, trying to make a wall out of luggage to keep back the zombies, as well as throwing a grenade inside a plane. All of it awesome. Brad Pitt is exceptionally lucky to survive a plane crash, no seat belt or anything!<br>
• Ach, there&#8217;s almost no gore. This is a PG-13 film. Amputations don&#8217;t have the expected accompanying sound or blood as the arm is generally off-screen or shot quickly. Pitt said he wanted to make a horror film his kids could see.<br>
• Action set pieces:<br>
Getting fuel into airplane at night/rain (meh)<br>
Israel wall (short but some cool shots)<br>
CDC collect viral samples (really enjoyable &#8211; also thanks for making it a tense corridor gauntlet instead of another boring zombie pile-on sequence. They made the right choice scrapping the Russia 3rd act.)<br>
• I love the thinking-it-out approach to exposition, theory and test &#8211; perhaps if you were to become diseased, the zombies would ignore you, like biological camouflage!<br>
• Just once I&#8217;d like people to watch where they&#8217;re stepping! COME ON! Your life depends on it!</p>
<p><strong>Overall: The film&#8217;s logic is a bit wobbley and the wife is quite annoying, but I quite enjoyed this zombie flick, particularly the final jaunt in the CDC. Recommend! (in 2D)</strong></p>
