			<p>WOOT! TOUGH ENOUGH will return in 2015! Vinnie Mac tweeted it out on Thursday. Hopefully whoever wins fares better than Angry Andy Levine. Remember him? Of course you don&#8217;t. He was shit-canned after Vince blew up at him for mis-selling a stunner &amp; slap. As well as his only talent is being tall. He&#8217;s the cousin of Dan Spivey and still works for WWC in Puerto Rico.</p>

			<p>• The first proper episode (the pilot was the casting session). The gang get start their training and their trainers, specifically drill sergeant Taz. Jason (the jakked guy) noted in an interview this year that during training, they all hated seeing Taz come to the house because he worked them so hard.<br>
• Bump drills! Horrible horrible bump drills. Victoria keeps banging her head and her resolve to be a wrestler is bit shaken.<br>
• Nowinski is best prepared being a fit ex-footballer with 3-6 months of wrestling training. Tori chastises him for explaining foot positions the non-WWF way.<br>
• One of the guys has a Goldberg poster up, which Taz tears down saying &#8220;wrong company&#8221;.<br>
• Bit of tussling in pig mud, where Jason and Paulina hurt her knee.<br>
• Daryl&#8217;s already making excuses about being sick. Taz chews him out for being out of shape, it&#8217;s a little funny.<br>
<em>Decent, Taz &amp;Daryl are the highlights of an easily digestible 22m.</em></p>

			<p>• Just like episode 2, Josh Matthews is always the first in the door to the training facility.<br>
• Oh shit, it&#8217;s Triple H! More bumping drills: Aitch has to tell Daryl one of his nuts is hanging out as he&#8217;s got a big hole in his shorts. Died.<br>
• This is the episode with THAT Triple H speech, it&#8217;s still excellent &#8211; heartfelt, stern and very real. About respecting the business; &#8220;you either want it or you don&#8217;t; and if you don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t waste our fuckin&#8217; time.&#8221;<br>
• In a DVD extra, we get quite the full speech, where H chews them out over that Goldberg poster; initially praising his athleticism but saying he can&#8217;t wrestle more than 4 minutes, had his fame handed to him and has no heart for wrestling (calling in sick when he can). The detraction is the obnoxious 90s freeform camerawork zooming and panning to get multiple shots in one swoop.<br>
• Some fun 2001 technology &#8211; corded landlines and discmans. It might air in 2001 but the house was furnished in the 90s, brah!<br>
• We get a lot of Nidia talking, it&#8217;s terrible &#8211; she &#8216;dissects&#8217; her feelings towards Chris and gives us the idiot line &#8220;Big offered to take us out, so we had to suck it up and look pretty&#8221;. JAYSUS.<br>
• It&#8217;s mentioned that Daryl is the oldest at 25. As a consequence of Triple H&#8217;s speech, Jason (the most ripped guy) quits.<br>
<em>This episode is a must-watch for the Triple H segment (and Daryl&#8217;s nut); nothing&#8217;s gonna top this episode.</em></p>

			<p>• At Trax (The training facility), blonde Victoria looks dangerous in the ring, and Daryl&#8217;s clothes smell (he can&#8217;t wear his shorts with the big hole in it). Amazing. This guy makes for great TV.<br>
• After the training session, everyone&#8217;s knees have nasty contusions.<br>
• Victoria and Bobbie Jo decide to quit together. Wow, the women left have a 3 in 1 chance of winning. Tall Paulina keeps doubting her resolve, she&#8217;ll quit soon&#8230;So it&#8217;s really between Nidia and Taylor (whom we almost never see). Slam bloody dunk, Nidia!<br>
• There&#8217;s a candle &#8220;fire&#8221; in the house which seemed like cheap heat. Ba dum tish!<br>
• Stephanie McMahon takes the girls out for lunch. She gets over how important that everyone&#8217;s like family and how funny the roster is, especially Aitch. She&#8217;s really her father&#8217;s daughter! Steph came off very well here.<br>
• Since Al Snow has a match on Smackdown, the team are treated to front row seats. Fucking stacked roster of 2001! Austin, Rock, Taker, Kane, HHH Benoit, Jericho (not to mention Angle, Hardyz etc).<br>
• Maven responds to in-house drama in a very positive and professional manner, so the cameras don&#8217;t spend much time with him (i.e. you&#8217;ll go far in the show). If they focus on you, you&#8217;re gonna be out.<br>
<em>Apart from Daryl&#8217;s clothes smelling there wasn&#8217;t too much fun, it was a stop-gap to to weed out the quitters so now we can really begin.</em></p>
