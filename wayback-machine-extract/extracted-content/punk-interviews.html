                                            Both Punk Interviews on the Art of Wrestling                                        </h1>
                                        <p>Last week, CM Punk was on the Art of Wrestling podcast, and spoke frankly about his departure from WWE, blasting all aspects of the company. It&#8217;s tremendously refreshing to hear a top-line wrestler speak openly and candidly about WWE, just something you don&#8217;t hear &#8211; most ex-wrestlers towing the company line, just in case they wanted to do business again.It&#8217;s an incredible must-listen interview, even if you&#8217;re not a wrestling fan. Punk is an eloquent speaker, and although I&#8217;ve no doubt that some stories are exaggerated, even if 25% of it is true, his insight was a depressing look into the &#8216;real&#8217; WWE. In amazing timing, it was released a few days after Vince was announced doing a live interview with Stone Cold on the WWE Network! Even better, Punk promised round-2 with Colt to clarify any big things before closing the book on it. Here&#8217;s a recounting and my thoughts on the Punk interview, the relevant parts from the Vince interview and Punk&#8217;s follow-up podcast this week:</p>
<p>Punk&#8217;s reasons for leaving WWE boil down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being injured</li>
<li>A toxic work environment (specifically with Triple H)</li>
<li>Being creatively under-booked,</li>
<li>Not being financially compensated well enough for it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1) Being Injured and working hurt</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cena rolling wrong and tearing his knee at Night of Champions</li>
<li>Hounded by Vince to return quickly after knee and elbow surgery (i.e. called as he was leaving the hospital, going on the road after 4 days); getting lazer eye surgery and someone obviously scratching his eye during the Nexus debut</li>
<li>Ryback: Specifically mentioning &#8220;steroid guy&#8221;, who &#8220;took 20 years off my life&#8221; &#8211; being extremely rough with him while working hurt; eg breaking his ribs kicking him. Their TLC match on RAW was &#8220;a horribly dangerous match with a horribly dangerous wrestler&#8221;. Upon confronting Ryback (&#8220;are you dumb as fuck or doing it on purpose?&#8221;) Ryback said he was sorry and dumb as fuck.</li>
<li><em>Ryback since denied the conversation and states he&#8217;ll still work as hard training, improving and cutting promos in his car. He also posted a picture of his figures celebrating after putting Punk through a table. Ha! Great.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>He blasts WWE doctor Dr. Amann and labels concussion testing as useless and simply a PR stunt</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dr suspiciously continuously refused to excise a lump (presumably a sebaceous cyst) that became life-threateningly infected with Staph. He went to AJ Lee&#8217;s doctor and had it properly diagnosed and treated. <em>I think Punk is right to put his faith in his company&#8217;s doctor (initially) but what he&#8217;s saying here tantamount to malpractice and criminal negligence. Of course his settlement with WWE would preclude him from suing them over this.</em></li>
<li>Being overprescribed Azithromycin (an antibiotic marketed as &#8220;Z-Pak&#8221;) until he literally shit his pants during a smackdown match. Hilarious.</li>
<li>WWE&#8217;s doctors batted away Punk&#8217;s concerns about having a concussion. Despite having one, he passed concussion testing while texting Colt and listening to music, and was asked to perform more tests despite passing the concussion test (rendering the test a joke). Although WWE gave a generic &#8220;our healthcare is great and doctors are respected&#8221;, <em>Vince never mentioned or refuted these claims&#8230;so as it stands, Punk&#8217;s word is the definitive truth.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) A Toxic Work Environment/mutual dislike with Triple H</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>He mentions many slights, such as being offered and accepted the lead in WWE Studios&#8217; 12 Rounds 2, if it wasn&#8217;t during the European Tour (he wanted to go as he was champion). H argued it wasn&#8217;t, but it was, and recast Orton as the lead without telling Punk first. He found out on WWE.com. That&#8217;s both spiteful and unprofessional of H.</li>
<li>Requested to take an extra urine test, despite Batista and Triple H not doing the same</li>
<li>The Shield was his creation &#8211; he wanted Ambrose, Rollins and Chris Hero as his backup; WWE came back with Big Show (groan!), Daniel Bryan and &#8220;a guy from FCW&#8221; i.e. Rollins. They agreed to exchange Hero for Roman Reigns. Then before debuting, it was changed so the Shield had no official affiliation with Punk, and now it&#8217;s Triple H/WWE&#8217;s idea, not Punk&#8217;s.</li>
<li>Although less than enthused with being asked about working Kane, he flat-out refused to wrestle Triple H at Mania 29, embittered by their horrible feud in Summer 2011.</li>
<li>Wanted a new character, with shorts and sponsorships (like Brock), was told no by Vince. A year later, part-timer Brock comes in with shorts with sponsorships on them.</li>
<li>Asked to walk friend &amp; UFC fighter Chael Sonnen to the Octagon, as WWE champion it&#8217;d be great free publicity. Vince refused (saying UFC was &#8216;barbaric&#8217;) but weeks later, Triple H walked Floyd Mayweather to the ring.</li>
<li>The Big One &#8211; His Wedding Day: Months into his &#8216;sabbatical&#8217;, Aitch got in touch with him about returning, Punk said they&#8217;ll talk after his honeymoon (i.e. he&#8217;s open to it) but instead was officially fired on his wedding day. This was an intentional, cowardly, personal, spiteful act that should never be forgotten.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Creatively Underbooked &amp; not compensated financially for it</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Punk repeatedly mentions booking scenarios that all see him main event wrestlemania (Three way with Batista and Randy, Three way with Rock and Cena). It&#8217;s his ultimate goal.</li>
<li>Annoyed at losing to part-timers, why he should lose to people who won&#8217;t be around for the rest of the year.</li>
<li>If he&#8217;s not working the main event, he demanded to be paid the same as Rock, Cena, Taker etc.</li>
<li>Turned heel as a favour to Vince, despite it cutting his merchandise sales in half.</li>
<li>Feuding with Ryback was physically dangerous, and did it as a favour to Vince.</li>
<li>Unhappy with Creative &#8211; if you speak up, the writers will start writing you worse. There&#8217;s no plans for what&#8217;s next with anyone, Vince just cares about Cena.</li>
<li>He believes his own hype, that he&#8217;s the greatest creative and financial draw in wrestling. <em>His massive ego is to be expected, all wrestlers have to believe that (if not, who else will?) Whilst it is true he outsold Cena in merchandise for a little while as babyface champion, WWE made the right financial decision that Rock/Cena II headlines WM29. Rock/Cena at WM28 was THE BIGGEST GROSSING WRESTLING EVENT OF ALL TIME, a rematch is likely bigger than any other fresh matchup. I agree with Punk that it was creatively boring, but it&#8217;s easy to understand WWE&#8217;s decision. What&#8217;s more, Punk knew Rock/Cena was the plan *6 months in advance*, so it&#8217;s hard to sympathise with them not changing their plan that makes financial sense. Punk only held the WWE so long as he was gonna drop it to the Rock at the Rumble. He was offered a plan B: Stay babyface, and have heel Bryan get the belt and job to Rock instead.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>WWE repeatedly refused to reissue and old cheque Punk forgot to cash, and wouldn&#8217;t send him his regular royalty cheques. He eventually got it and then some in his settlement.</li>
<li>WWE Network was a reason for leaving. He spoke up to Vince &amp; H about his concerns about payment re: the network killing their PPV business, and was repeatedly told they don&#8217;t know. <em>WWE did delay paying wrestlers for as long as possible, and paying them less, although considering the tremendous startup costs of the Network ($75 million) and it&#8217;s underperformance (728k subscribers at the moment) the wrestlers were somewhat happy with their payoff.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Other things to note about Punk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Settled (not sued) WWE, getting his royalties and damages. Although he can&#8217;t disclose details, he got WWE for a lot of money. He even refused to sign a non-disparagement clause (&#8216;because WWE need to feel like they&#8217;ve won&#8217;)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Happiest he&#8217;s been in years, healthy (for a wrestler), loves his non-WWE ventures, and is financially set without them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Punk is a huge wrestling mark. <em>He absolutely loves the sport, hates how his ideas were taken from him, and repeatedly states his goal was to main event WrestleMania. It&#8217;s only when he&#8217;s been booked in an undercard match, then seeks adequate compensation as if he was. Hey, it&#8217;s great he cares so deeply about the on-screen. We need more Bret Harts and less Kevin Nashs in wrestling.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He chose his buddy Colt as his outlet, and stopped talking to people who had something to gain from it (ie dirtsheet reporters, podcasters like Chris Jericho)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Recounts Vince&#8217;s (crocodile) tears when he said he quit (in front of Hunter) saying they&#8217;re family, and their asinine decision to wait a few months to tell him he&#8217;s in breach of contract. <em>Vince was said to be upset over the interview, it was Triple H who was livid &#8220;wanting his head/to kill Punk&#8221;. </em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Very aware of dirtsheets and the opposing negative smark comments esp. on twitter. He specifically mentions being called a &#8220;quieter&#8221; (which is hilarious) and explains blocking people as &#8220;twitter is like the fucking open window in my kitchen with somebody yelling in it&#8221;. He acknowledges disrespectful fans, specifically citing an &#8216;incident&#8217; at a Blackhawks game, which got picked up by the dirtsheets. The fan shouted &#8220;HEY PHIL!&#8221; and requested a photo, which Punk regarded as impolite and blew him off. <em>Although I&#8217;d agree that politeness is key, I&#8217;d wager most fans don&#8217;t know how to act when they&#8217;re close to one of their idols. Even I got a little starstruck meeting Dean Ambrose, for example. He should&#8217;ve spent more time hammering how to act, instead of chastising bad behaviour.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The first podcast an incredible interview, and maybe Punk&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s difficult to fight the system when you&#8217;re rehabbing injuries, fighting for your spot, while having a busy road schedule. I recounted it in detail as he says a lot of important things. Also, WWE wouldn&#8217;t want to be caught out like they did with Del Rio and Punk&#8230;Maybe he can change WWE sitting on his couch.</p>

<p><strong>Vince&#8217;s Interview with Steve Austin on the WWE Network:</strong></p>
<p>As expected, Vince gave business answers and Austin did not pick up Vince on any of his bullshit. Still an entertaining listen as it&#8217;s probably the best we&#8217;ll ever get out of Vince. They only talked about Punk for about 20 seconds; saying firing him on his wedding day was a miscommunication error between wwe and the lawyers, and he&#8217;s sorry and hopes they can work together again someday.</p>
<p>As a side note, Vince in general took NO responsibility for any of WWE&#8217;s problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Punk leaving was largely due to his lack of communication and him being a loner</li>
<li>JR left because he was unprofessional, not working hard enough</li>
<li>WWE Superstars aren&#8217;t ambitious enough, encouraging them to take risks (despite burying those who do, Zack Ryder anyone!)</li>
<li>No competition? The territories put themselves out of business (which is Bret screwed Bret levels of bollocks!)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Punk&#8217;s Follow-up Interview:</strong></p>
<p>Part 2 had an extremely different vibe &#8211; an easy-going chat, with just a few wrestling tidbits, often diverting into talking about TV shows and movies.</p>
<p>Points to note from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Punk knows the lyrics to Honky Tonk&#8217;s WWF theme (that&#8217;s awesome)</li>
<li>Sees both sides of people chanting CM Punk at AJ, hopes people chant AJ; and understands CM Punk chants when something WWE puts on is awful.</li>
<li>He didn&#8217;t rule out a return to WWE but has no interest. He dismisses how Jericho says he&#8217;s like him in 2005, (ie just wait 2.5 years) but he wasn&#8217;t fired on his wedding day.</li>
<li>He doesn&#8217;t accept Vince&#8217;s publicity stunt apology. If was truly sorry he&#8217;d&#8217;ve said so in June, or call or visit, not wait until a WWE network special.</li>
</ul>
<p>He mentions a few more slights WWE did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wizard World offered Punk $20,000 for 4 hours work. They asked WWE and said no, here&#8217;s AJ, Bryan and the Shield. The reasoning being they &#8216;need him&#8217; on the Mexico tour &#8211; so Punk demanded $20,000 as a pay off. They agreed, then paid him $5,000. Punk threw a strop and got another $4,000.</li>
<li>THQ asked WWE for Punk on the cover, WWE came back with &#8220;how about Sheamus&#8221; and Punk was sent an email chain of them trying to push them away from Punk.</li>
<li>LA Ink wanted Punk (it was set up by Punk&#8217;s friend) and WWE said no, here&#8217;s Randy</li>
<li>He got crabby when multiple people came up to punk reminding him to put over Roman and the lads while winning a 3-on-1. Even people who had nothing to do with the match. He was fine with it but was annoyed being badgered, and offered to put them over themselves, just shut up.</li>
<li>He&#8217;s also very happy for Del Rio, saying you can&#8217;t put a no-compete on an independent contractor.</li>
<li>He ended it by thanking his fans for supporting him and buying his merch. If u don&#8217;t like him, don&#8217;t follow him on twitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall: An easy, enjoyable but unnecessary listen; more he booked having a follow-up interview in case there was more things he needed to clarify (and great timing in case Vince said anything contentious on the Austin show.) He sounded like it&#8217;d all blown over already, he&#8217;s got his closure. Although neither Vince or Punk&#8217;s follow-up is necessary but an entertaining listen. Hearing all of these petty, intentional slights makes me pissed off for him! Definitely check out the first interview if you haven&#8217;t!</p>
