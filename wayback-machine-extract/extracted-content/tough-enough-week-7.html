<hr>
<p>â€¢ Kick off! The judges take turns quickly giving each participant a piece of advice. Great little add-in. However they&#8217;ve re-added the long bouts of clapping before and after the break, and the awful generic pop soundtrack is more pervasive than ever.<br>
â€¢ <strong>Amanda</strong> is happy to have her looks help her get to the top, and ZZ is shown sulking about nobody wanting him here. He looks like he&#8217;s lost weight (later he says 8 pounds). This week&#8217;s challenges centre around pairing up and teamwork.<br>
â€¢ <strong>Challenge 1: Work together for a quick in-ring sequence.</strong> Billy reads ZZ the riot act for gassing out in 2 minutes. A big hoopla is made over Sara Lee botching a powerslam (Daniel Bryan rightly points out it didn&#8217;t look that bad, as is disappointed in Gigi for playing it up), whilst Josh &amp; Tanner kill it, winning the challenge. Josh gets the shine &#8211; He&#8217;s the guy WWE want, as the tallest/biggest guy. He&#8217;s put over as super-focused and capable. I get this is a reality show so they need to show &#8220;interesting&#8221; activities to grab ratings, but how is this a decent evaluation of in-ring talent? How is any of this useful?! ðŸ˜€<br>
â€¢ Miz oddly heels out on the fans, calls ZZ a <strong>lazy underachiever</strong> &#8216;which the fans can relate to&#8217;. Everyone reacts mildly surprised.<br>
â€¢ <strong>Josh offers Tanner to hit on him</strong> to up his game (e.g. pretend I&#8217;m a woman) real reality TV fodder. They play it up on Tough Talk, boo.<br>
â€¢ <strong>Challenge 2: Fireman (not the carry) rescue exercise</strong> &#8211; attach a hose to a fire hydrant, put out a fire, find a dummy survivor and get out. featuring the Prime Time Players! They show up with their tag belts. This sequence is INTENSELY edited (even for a reality show) so it&#8217;s just a mess. ZZ (who has experience as a volunteer fire fighter) and Tanner do the best, giving ZZ some much-needed props. Josh is shown as doing almost everything himself, but this doesn&#8217;t bite him in the ass.<br>
â€¢ Calmer hen clucking as <strong>Chelsea</strong> admits to intentionally not working together with Amanda, wanting to stand out regardless of instructions. She&#8217;s gonna get put in the bottom 3 for that remark.<br>
â€¢ <strong>BOTTOM 3: Amanda</strong> (Miz, a segment early, says him saving her went straight to her head) <strong>Gigi</strong> (Bryan, for over-reacting about the powerslam) and <strong>Sara Lee</strong> (Paige, for not apologising after botching the powerslam). So&#8230;none of those are really teamwork reasons, which the challenges centred around. Hang on! <strong>AMAZING swerve by Miz</strong>, he changes his nomination to <strong>Chelsea</strong>, for awful teamwork. What a troll.<br>
â€¢ <strong>Final 30s Plea:</strong> Sara-Lee (&#8220;I&#8217;m here to learn&#8221; &#8211; meh), Gigi (&#8220;I need to be here&#8221; &#8211; very good), Chelsea (heelish &#8220;I deserve to be here&#8221; &#8211; good, but you won&#8217;t win sympathy with it). Weird to see an all-female bottom 3, first time that&#8217;s happened. <strong>Paige saves Gigi</strong> (which gets a big pop &#8211; she would&#8217;ve gone home), meaning Chelsea&#8217;s fucked. As the 2nd lowest with 25%, <strong>Chelsea&#8217;sÂ gone.</strong> She puts over Gigi to win it, and we&#8217;re done</p>
<p><strong>Overall: Oh man, it&#8217;s difficult to find things to praise about this week&#8217;s show. Em&#8230;my 5 minute review will save you watching 90 minutes?</strong></p>

<p><strong>TOUGH TALK</strong><br>
â€¢ <strong>Hilarious new graphic.</strong> I didn&#8217;t see the ring ropes for DB and Paige, thought they were posing like rappers. BÂ Dazzle is back! He has to be prodded so say anything &#8211; his head was somewhere else this week. He just keeps grindingÂ the same point about Chelsea playing up whining about a somewhat dangerous powerslam.<br>
â€¢ <strong>Amanda:</strong> Paige says she would&#8217;ve nominated her for elimination, but didn&#8217;t as Miz said he would. They make Amanda out to look really bad, very shallow, and is put in a tight position and ends up slagging Chelsea&#8217;s looks. She should&#8217;ve referenced that she came to Chelsea nicely about their poor performance in the challenge, who responded by saying she&#8217;s basically going into business for herself.<br>
â€¢ <strong>Gigi:</strong> Frustrated that she&#8217;s was in the bottom 3, asÂ she&#8217;s been performing in challenges. <strong>Paige has really toned it down this week</strong> &#8211; great! &#8211; she gives out that TE is a popularity contest, indirectly jabbing Sara Lee. 52% of the votes! Take that WWE! This &#8220;Sara&#8217;s a liability&#8221; conversation lasts an ice age. She butts in to defend herself, giving us a perfect visual of Tough Enough and the fans&#8217; (and my) voting preferences.<br>
â€¢ <strong>The next 10 minutes is spent burying ZZ</strong>: Miz likens himÂ to Daniel Puder (the fan favourite who was gone a year later). Kurt must not be anywhere close to coming back to WWE, but I appreciated the Tough Enough Season 4 reference. (Angle was embarassed by MMA-background Puder in a quickie shoot-fight on Smackdown &#8211; the most notable thing to come out of ANY tough enough season). <strong>Bryan HOUNDS ZZ</strong> about basically lying about wanting to get in shape. Smartly (and very tellingly) Miz asks about ZZ being<strong> a three-time Reality show star</strong> (the implication being ZZ&#8217;s not interested in being a wrestler). FYI, ZZ was on &#8220;Trading Spouses&#8221; when his mother traded places with a vegan mom when he was 8, and again was &#8220;Swamp People&#8221; when he was 16.<br>
â€¢ Force that Josh/Tanner bromance deal again and we&#8217;re done.</p>
<p><strong>Overall: Sadly it&#8217;s another forgettable week, Byron Saxton did a poor job keeping Tough Talk moving along, and it&#8217;s not enjoyable seeing WWE bury ZZ or making Amanda look bad. It doesn&#8217;t work well to have your top babyface as boring heel with no-one to take his place. But hey, Tough Enough is about people wanting to become wrestlers, and so it&#8217;s always interesting to me. It feels like Lance Storm&#8217;s students (Chelsea &amp; Gigi) are the only actually decent hires out of the bunch (I can&#8217;t see Josh, Tanner or ZZ becoming anything/sticking around long term). Nevermind though, there&#8217;s only 3 weeks left! And Cena&#8217;ll show upÂ next time.</strong></p>
