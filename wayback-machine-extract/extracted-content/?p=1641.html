<div style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>What you should know from Pact 1:</strong> Annie believes her family home to be haunted, so she gets her psychic friend Stevie to help out. Her uncle is the Judas killer, and with help from a ghost of a deceased victim (Jennifer Glick), she puts a bullet in Judas&#8217; head and escapes. The last shot shows Judas&#8217; eyes opening.</div>
<p><strong>Cast/Crew: </strong>I must mention that Caity Lotz (Annie) is given top billing, despite her having what amounts to an extended cameo. Perhaps it&#8217;s a shady marketing tactic as she landed a recurring role in TV show Arrow (as Sara Lance). The film mainly features Camilla Luddington as June Abbot, a daughter of a Judas Killer victim as mentioned above.</p>
<p><strong>Plot:</strong> June experiences unsettling events in her house. She comes to believe she&#8217;s being haunted by the (supposedly deceased) serial killer, Judas, whilst a copycat killer is on the loose.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts :</strong><br>
• June experiences horrible visions/nightmares relating to victims of Judas, and wakes up in odd places (eg bathroom, car) with a knife in her hand. I thought this was a nice plot-swerve. She draws these vivid nightmares as a hobby.<br>
• She lives with her boyfriend who is oblivious to these events as he&#8217;s a policeman who works overnight.<br>
• This film has flashbacks making you feel bad, like you really missed out if you didn&#8217;t see the previous film. However they&#8217;re actually only relevant to this film &#8211; there&#8217;s not much you need to know, as seen from above.<br>
• We&#8217;ll get this out of the way, as there are positives. I have two big gripes with this film:<br>
1) Once again, what is this pact? It&#8217;s not explained in the film.<br>
2) June is depicted as a cleaner for crime scenes. She asks her boyfriend to &#8220;put in a good word for her&#8221; so she can work this new crime scene. This is COMPLETE BULLSHIT. Biohazard remediation is a industry job, not fucking freelance. There&#8217;s a TEAM of people with specialised equipment, not some weirdo with a sponge and a bucket. WTF! It&#8217;s completely wrong here (just to serve a plot point) and pissed me off.<br>
• OK! Good things &#8211; right off the bat, you can see a much bigger budget, the film looks nice, not shot in one empty, shithole apartment.<br>
• The music and editing is much improved. Annie is even prettier.<br>
• Hallmarks of the Judas Killer haunting is lights being affected/blowing out, electronics turning on (especially TV/record player), decapitations. There&#8217;s a cool scene where June&#8217;s in bed and she sees a lampshade silhouette of a humanoid shape that disappears, comes back and starts moving. I thought it was great.<br>
• I enjoyed the one semi-4th wall nod; when something is creepily foreboding, Annie says &#8220;Goddammit, I hate this shit&#8221;.<br>
• Much like in the first film, there&#8217;s a question mark over whether Judas is real or a ghost, and if the ghost/who&#8217;s haunting you is good or malevolent. Good stuff.<br>
• Jazz-type music instruments cacophany go off when ghost/killers are making themselves known. Is a bit iffy but it&#8217;s fine.<br>
• June&#8217;s Pink room investigation was absolutely useless. The plot happens without anything gained. Perhaps it&#8217;s to make the big finale obvious but it wasn&#8217;t needed.<br>
• I was initially annoyed that when June just sees these horrible visions, she doesn&#8217;t bolt. She later calmly explains (thank you) that whatever it is, it&#8217;s attached to her, so running away won&#8217;t help anything. She won&#8217;t tell her boyfriend as he won&#8217;t believe her. I always appreciate a film addressing these basic logical questions.<br>
• The other main player in the film is FBI Agent Ballard, who is a profiler. He&#8217;s a cold and blunt, almost to the level of condescension. He cannot feign sincere politeness and it&#8217;s obvious that his questions are intentionally leading. June and her boyfriend are relatively nice to him. It&#8217;s the wrong type of heat for me (I didn&#8217;t want to see/deal with him) but it does play into the ending sequence so in that respect it works.<br>
• The ending sequence/revelation/how it plays out is a lot of fun but the epilogue/final scene is a groaning &#8220;see you next time&#8230;in PACT 3!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Overall: A better film in every respect than the first: the acting, budget, music, editing, story. However most people seemed to really like the original and not really this one. If you&#8217;re thinking of seeing it, watch both and let me know! A good (but not stand-alone) film.</strong></p>
