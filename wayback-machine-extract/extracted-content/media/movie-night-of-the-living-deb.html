<p><strong>Plot: </strong>Horror comedy about single woman Deb, as the zombie apocalypse hits her quiet town of Portland.</p>
<p><strong>Cast/Crew: </strong>Directed and written by Kyle Rankin, starring Maria Thayer (Wyoma in Forgetting Sarah Marshall) as Deb, and Michael Cassidy aka Zach on The O.C. (don&#8217;t call it that) as Ryan, the one night stand.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts on the film:</strong><br>
• I&#8217;ve decided to go through the film beat by beat rather than just thoughts, lemme know if this better/worse!<br>
• Introduced to quirky/unlucky in love Deb and her bestie Julie at a bar, as Deb awkwardly flirts with Ryan, a man openly having a row with his fiancé. It immediately scores points with an Arrested Development reference, as gorgeous fiancé Stacy shouts &#8220;SAY GOODBYE TO THESE!&#8221;!<br>
• She wakes up at Ryan&#8217;s place (trying to stay as he&#8217;s ushering her out) and they find the town now populated with the undead. A horror comedy in a suburban zombie apocalypse? The iconic Shaun of the Dead is the immediate comparison. It&#8217;s like a heavily-inspired American version, with a light-hearted tone as Deb cracks jokes despite seeing zombie murders; and not taking it too seriously, marking out with &#8220;that was awesome&#8221; after killing Miss Jones. Fourth wall breaking as Deb considers the type of zombie (&#8220;ah the slow ones that look like they have CP&#8221;).<br>
• Awesome visual gag, someone&#8217;s written &#8220;Your all gonna die&#8221; on a wall, and someone in red spray-paint has corrected the grammar. A+ (1:01:03)<br>
• They&#8217;re inconsistent zombies (as is their nature!) They in general want to eat you, but the coffee shop owner slams Ryan on a table (as opposed to trying to eat him first). They also eat &#8216;dead&#8217; zombies which I found odd.<br>
• Threads a very thin line between wise-cracking protagonist and annoying desperate unmarried woman. The zany suburban white woman shouts &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch a black man&#8217;s radio!&#8221;. X-Pac heat there! The progression of her character goes from initially being quite grating/overbearingly &#8220;I&#8217;M FUNNY&#8221; to becoming more relaxed/affable/&#8221;steady girlfriend material&#8221; by the end.<br>
• After seeing Ryan has nothing in his house, they decide to go to his rich dad&#8217;s estate. Ryan&#8217;s character starts out as a guy-bimbo with aspirations towards helping the environment, and the main two have trouble connecting on a personal level. It&#8217;s hilarious that his brother Chaz is a sarcastic layabout, and immediately bonds with Deb over insulting Ryan. It&#8217;s quite funny.<br>
• Indoors we get the exposition. What caused the outbreak? It&#8217;s a parasite-borne virus in the city water, as his dad&#8217;s boss demanded they open a treatment centre that wasn&#8217;t ready yet. This &#8220;Ichabod virus&#8221; refers to the real-life 30,000 year old virus first found a decade ago and &#8216;brought to life&#8217; in 2014 (ie when the film was being written).<br>
• Why isn&#8217;t anyone coming to help? Internet&#8217;s down, it&#8217;s a very small town, and a private security company has blocked the roads. What this means is the film&#8217;s shot in empty roads/buildings and sprinkle some zombies in there.</p>

<hr>
<p>• Ryan&#8217;s (smoking hot) fiancé is also at the estate, and tries to seduce Ryan after their big fight (but he&#8217;s interested in Deb now), so she dresses in lingerie and starts bouncing/screaming on the bed, causing Deb to leave in the middle of the night.<br>
• Deb is detained at the Army Checkpoint. The bumbling boss has some funny lines &#8220;They say shooting a gun is like an organ. That&#8217;s why it must be harder for women to..&#8221; *gets cut off*<br>
• The estate is overrun and Ryan &amp; his dad end up at the check point too. When the Army are exposed as heels, Deb &amp; Ryan decide to head to the TV station to broadcast a plight for help.<br>
• Ugly duckling gimmick: They actually do a decent job of the typical uglifying the geeky girl so she can reveal herself as gorgeous later on. Deb looks amazing in a coctail dress.<br>
• The distress broadcast goes viral (somehow) and it cuts to a montage of selfie reaction YouTube videos, which HAVE TO be kickstarter perks for the highest backers! (I checked it out, yes.)<br>
• Super happy finish, bucking the usual rules of zombies, that you can&#8217;t turn via zombie bite. Chaz exclaims &#8220;We&#8217;re alive and under arrest!&#8221; (shows handcuffs) and we&#8217;re out.</p>
<p><strong>Overall: An easy watch but Deb isn&#8217;t as charming as the film hoped it&#8217;d be. Night of the Living Deb makes for a great last-movie-of-the-night horror festival movie. Can&#8217;t recommend but it&#8217;s good to see kickstarter horror films being made.</strong></p>
