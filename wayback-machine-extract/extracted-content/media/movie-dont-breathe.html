<hr>
<p><strong>Plot:</strong> Thriller about a group of (amateur) thieves who want to steal from a blind but capable Army vet. The job gets messy.</p>
<p><strong>Cast/Crew:</strong> Written/directed/produced by Fede Alvarez (Evil Dead remake), starring Jane Levy (Evil Dead remake), Dylan Minnette (Zach in Goosebumps) &amp; Daniel Zovatto (Jack in Fear the Walking Dead) as the thieves, and Stephen Lang (American Colonel in Avatar) as the army vet.</p>
<p><strong>Production Tidbits:</strong><br>
• Director/Writer, co-writer, producer, composer and female actress all worked on the Evil Dead remake.<br>
• Shot in Hungary with a few scenics in Detroit.<br>
• Most shot in the house &#8211; v. cheap to make ($10m &#8211; half of the Evil Dead remake) which allowed for less studio interference.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong><br>
• It opens with a foreshadowing shot, which is also maybe 10 minutes before the end of the film. Since it&#8217;s not the very end it&#8217;s not that bad, but from it you&#8217;d guess what happens to get there.<br>
• Who&#8217;s the mark? A retired army vet. Why? He&#8217;s a blind loner. What&#8217;s the vig? He&#8217;s said to be holding $300,000 in his house.<br>
• The house is on a street called &#8220;Buena Vista&#8221; or &#8220;Good Sight&#8221; ha ha. Zing!<br>
• What makes this film interesting? It&#8217;s a game of cat &amp; mouse, and both &#8220;sides&#8221; have different strengths. The thieves: There&#8217;s three of them, healthy, young and can see (lol)<br>
The Army Vet: Blind, older but physically much stronger, with combat training, has his dog, and he&#8217;s on his home turf. Makes for a great dynamic.<br>
• As the story is set, we&#8217;re on the thieves&#8217;s side &#8211; they&#8217;re looking to escape their current lives. They&#8217;re delinquents but have some kind of morals &#8211; pick a guy who&#8217;s hoarding money, and bail rather than hurt him if possible. They&#8217;re amateur thieves, doing small break-ins thanks to Alex, the son of a guy who installs security systems. In the movie Alex doles out exposition/information (&#8220;this is B&amp;E, not murder!&#8221;, &#8220;Under 10,000 it&#8217;s petty theft!&#8221; etc) and has a crush on Rocky (the female thief).<br>
• The job was always going to go awry &#8211; they don&#8217;t spend long scouting (eg not knowing how many locks are on the door before they get there) and they are generally ill-equipped (a gun, crowbar, security fob and attitude is about all they have). The leader (&#8220;Money&#8221;) is a low-level thug who is easily frustrated (he starts pulling at the cellar door loudly when it&#8217;s locked). They do rookie things like taking their shoes off and leaving them in the house (leaving phones out/on vibrate etc), and tranquillise the dog only for a brief time &#8211; maybe 30 minutes tops.<br>
• The best reason to see this is to see the thieves try not get caught/give away that they&#8217;re even in the house, especially when they make a sound and the Army Vet suspects something. He&#8217;s blind but he&#8217;s still extremely dangerous.<br>
• There&#8217;s a couple of big turning points in the movie, like when the perps get found out, and the only locked door (to the basement) is opened. It&#8217;s a pretty great twist.<br>
• There&#8217;s some nice camera shots &#8211; when they first enter the house, there is a long one-take showing the thieves canvassing different rooms of the bottom floor. It&#8217;s pretty cool. The film makes sure to show you important objects that&#8217;ll come up later &#8212; ie THERE IS A GUN UNDER THE BED! HERE IS AN IRON MALLET! It&#8217;s like pro-wrestling booking! (everyone in Row Z can see exactly what&#8217;s going on)<br>
• There&#8217;s a scene when the lights go out (and everything goes black &amp; white) which is a pretty cool aesthetic. The actors playing the thieves wear contacts that make their pupils look massive (which makes sense as they&#8217;re looking around in the dark)<br>
• Couple of jump-scares in there which are a bit cheap, but the dread/tenseness of the movie is effective! Great!<br>
• I&#8217;d class it as a tense thriller, not horror. There&#8217;s no real gore or supernatural element, it&#8217;s &#8216;regular people&#8217; rather than a slasher villain/hillbilly. However The Blind Man does have some &#8216;Jason&#8217; moments, like appearing from a different place than expected and surveys the area like the monster out of Alien.<br>
• Oh man, there&#8217;s a &#8220;ohhhh shit!&#8221; revelation when the female thief is caught and put into a harness. We&#8217;ve seen it before (giving you expectations due to it&#8217;s previous use as a restraint) but the 1-2 punch with the new use of the harness, combined with the turkey baster is a real holy shit moment. The way that scene played out with grossly compelling. A memorable, very high low point of the film.<br>
• Only real negative is that the woman escapes and gets caught 1-2 many times. You&#8217;re kinda sick of the &#8216;almost!&#8217;  by the end. </p>
<p><strong>Overall: It was a fun thrill ride, overlooking that the characters aren&#8217;t memorable, and it&#8217;s very much a &#8216;in the moment/no backstory&#8217; film. It has an interesting premise, with effective, sustained tension that held my attention throughout, and there were some cool ideas/gross parts. Nothing revolutionary, it&#8217;s kinda one and done (you&#8217;ll forget about it the next day) so I won&#8217;t recommend it, but if it&#8217;s on TV or this sounds interesting to you, give it a whirl!</strong></p>
