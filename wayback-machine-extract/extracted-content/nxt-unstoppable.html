<p><strong>NXT TakeOver 6: Unstoppable!</strong><br>
<em>Wednesday 20th May from Full Sail University (FL), a 2-hour special on the WWE Network</em></p>
<p>Disappointing news, NXT oversold the event, meaning 100 or so people who had a ticket didn&#8217;t get in. Sorry @Fugoy brah! Also, Hideo Itami was injured/selling in the parking lot, and that&#8217;s the kayfabe reason for a torn rotator cuff, and being out of this next match:</p>
<p><strong>TYLER BREEZE VS. FINN BALOR</strong><br>
Tyler had a super version of his entrance with multiple &#8216;models&#8217; doing his selfie schtick, and had a furry red &amp; yellow cape! It suits him really well. Finn did his spectacular Demon entrance &#8211; this time he had a bat wingspan and horns down his spine outfit, and spray-painted a massive eye on his back. Love how theatrical he is, it&#8217;s main event grade. The crowd shout &#8220;Holy shit!&#8221; and a dad chants along, while ear-muffing his kid. Amazing.<br>
The match itself was what you&#8217;d expect but below what you&#8217;d hope. Finn survived a super-model kick, denied a Bloody Sunday, and dived onto Breeze from the top of the stage, which was 6 feet off the ground. He won with a double foot stomp in a decisive win and picks up the #1 contenders slot. Finn will (hopefully) be a megastar on the main roster but Tyler, I can&#8217;t see being anything beyond an Adam Rose/DJ Gabriel/(the world is) Sylvain Grenier level.</p>
<p>I gotta say, I LOVE how enthusiastic the <strong>NXT crowd</strong> are, they&#8217;re into everything, but they&#8217;re so obnoxious and smarky. They force themselves to chant constantly, from &#8220;please don&#8217;t die&#8221; (as Finn is 6 feet off the floor) to &#8220;you&#8217;re not counting&#8221; to the ref whilst the wrestlers are outside, to &#8220;marking out&#8221;, which is my second most hated chant (after &#8220;we are awesome&#8221;).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>EMMA &amp; DANA BROOKE VS. CHARLOTTE &amp; BAYLEY</strong></p>
<p>Emma&#8217;s dropping the dancing moron gimmick, looks much better with her new hair &amp; outfit. Dana (as the most green) was successfully hidden and the match wasn&#8217;t anything spectacular. I&#8217;M A NOGGER! I&#8217;m always impressed with Bayley, a wrestling character aimed specifically at young girls, a straight happy babyface that is easily likeable. It was unmemorable; the finish had Bayley give Brooke the Belly to Bayley and after a Figure 8 (bridging Figure 4) and a snapmare (&#8216;Natural Selection&#8217;) Charlotte picks up the win for the babyfaces and they do each other&#8217;s right analog stick taunts.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>RHYNO VS. BARON CORBIN</strong></p>
<p>Rhyno has access to R-Truth&#8217;s fountain of youth. He looks the same as he did in 2001. He was brought aboard for exactly this &#8211; wrestle with and improve younger talents, always dependable for a good match. Corbin&#8217;s gimmick of squashing people is very odd for a developmental territory (i.e. how is he supposed to improve?). He goes much longer in a 50/50 affair with Rhyno in a surprisingly decent match. They gassed out in the second half and picked up for the finish, which saw Corbin get the End of Days for the win.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>BLAKE &amp; MURPHY VS. ENZO AMORE &amp; COLIN CASSADY FOR TAG TITLES</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s weird how Blake &amp; Murphy are the champions, especially when almost everyone in NXT has a strong gimmick. They&#8217;re extremely bland. That could be worked into a gimmick but they haven&#8217;t. Enzo, Can of Piss &amp; Carmella do their SAWFT schtick (which is great). Enzo &amp; Cassady generally have control which means they&#8217;ll get the upset loss; Alexa Bliss heels out on Carmella, and banana-peels Enzo, so he crotches himself on the top rope, and Murphy gets the win. It was alright.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>SASHA BANKS VS. BECKY LYNCH FOR WOMEN&#8217;S TITLE</strong></p>
<p>Becky is wearing some kind of steampunk outfit and has dyed her hair electric red. She&#8217;s running through a lot of unsuccessful looks, I hope she finds the right one before coming to the main roster, I really want her to do well. These women got 15 MINUTES, and did a great job &#8211; it&#8217;s either this or the main event for match of the night. They embarrassed the main-roster Divas, who are both shackled by Vince &amp; Kevin Dunn&#8217;s portrayal of women, and couldn&#8217;t match the NXT females even if they did get 15 minutes, because the majority are models taught how to wrestle, not women wrestlers. Lots of working the arms; back suplex; Becky caught Banks and rushed her into the stairs whilst still selling her arm. Banks won with a top rope divorce court &amp; bank statement (crossface) for the submission win. I love how the winners tonight got a minute or so to celebrate, to let the win sink in. Fans sang Becky&#8217;s song and gave her a standing ovation afterwards. Great stuff.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>KEVIN OWENS VS SAMI ZAYN FOR THE NXT TITLE</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, KO said he stepped on the US title as the NXT title is the real prize (awesome). He again warned Sami not to show up as he&#8217;ll injure him for good. Even though Sami injured his shoulder, he&#8217;s been cleared to compete, which really means &#8216;do the PPV, further injure yourself, and then take time off to heal&#8217;. KO comes out wearing John Cena&#8217;s tee (like a boss!). Steen&#8217;s psychology and promos are tremendous. Only drawback is seeing what a nice guy/loving dad he is on Twitter, it jars with his CM-Punk style character. They had an entertaining match (it&#8217;s KO &amp; Zayn, how could they not!), 7 minutes in Owens powerbombs Sami into the apron, which injures him, and refs keep fending off Owen. It wasn&#8217;t stated but Owens should&#8217;ve been declared the winner by ref stoppage. He snuck in to kick Sayn in the head which was wonderful. Regal tried to get him to stop attacking Zayn and got headbutted for his troubles. Then Samoa Joe came out! Amazing to see him, looks in better shape already. His theme song sucks though, a TNA rip-off with a bit of dancing-pimp in there too. They went nose to nose but didn&#8217;t touch, Owens backed down and left. The whole thing was crazy over, with &#8220;Joe&#8217;s Gonna Kill You&#8221; and &#8220;Fight Owens Fight&#8221; chants. Joe&#8217;s still scheduled to work all his indie dates so it&#8217;s likely he&#8217;ll be like Rhyno, wrestling occasionally. <strong>Who do you wanna see Samoa Joe wrestle? And if he has to change his name, what would change it to? Besides &#8220;Joey Samoey&#8221;!</strong></p>
<p>Crowd watching: The Mountain from GoT (did you know? Samoa Joe is doing a voice-acting in GoT&#8217;s Telltale games!), Stephanie, the un-named Uhaa Nation and Eva Marie.</p>
<p><strong>So that was it! Good-but-nothing-spectacular undercard, but most importantly, the top 2 matches delivered; women in the ring, men storyline-wise, looking great for the future. What fate took away with Zayn &amp; Itami, WWE&#8217;ve booked themselves out of it with Owens at Elimination Chamber and Samoa Joe (and Finn) as KO&#8217;s next opponents. Great! Crazy to think WWE has a show with Generico, Steen, Devitt, KENTA and Samoa Joe in it! I&#8217;d recommend watching the last 2 matches.</strong></p>
