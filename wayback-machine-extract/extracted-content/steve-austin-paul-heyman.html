<p><em>A surprising return of Stone Cold to the WWE Network, as the softball-throwing Chris Jericho had replaced him for a brace of Network interviews, and Austin&#8217;s no longer involved in Tough Enough (due to continual delays in shooting). But to keep those new Network subscribers interested, they&#8217;ve paired up two of the biggest names in wrestling for an hour-long chat. Let&#8217;s do it to it!</em></p>
<p>From San Antonio (not backstage at RAW this time). Heyman asks Austin what&#8217;s the capital of Nebraska &#8211; it&#8217;s Lincoln. Super proud I knew that! They mention they&#8217;ve both been on each other&#8217;s podcast multiple times so they had to try find something new to talk about. There&#8217;s almost no ECW talk.</p>
<p><strong>Austin joining Heyman&#8217;s Dangerous Alliance in WCW.</strong><br>
He recounts meeting Austin and fawns over how he hit the ropes and locked up, in that it looked like a fight rather than a smooth choreographed motion. DA was supposed to be the new Horsemen but Heyman persuaded Dusty to add a 5th (Austin). Paul E. does a great Dusty impression.</p>
<p><strong>Brock Lesnar</strong><br>
Austin asks to go hunting with Brock. Heyman mentions Lesnar always goes back to being a farmer, and loves his kids 1st, and WWE 2nd.</p>
<p><strong>More clients? (Both avoid the term &#8220;Heyman guys&#8221;)</strong><br>
Paul smartly bats it away saying he&#8217;s Brock&#8217;s guy so it never works with other wrestlers; except for Punk, because they were friends and he can carry the ball himself (so Heyman was in a different, supporting role). No mention of Cesaro, Ryback, Axel etc. He says Punk probably wishes he joined UFC sooner, and will either shock everyone in UFC or get his ass kicked quickly, and is man enough to take his chances.</p>
<p><strong>WWE&#8217;s selling</strong><br>
Austin uses Jake Roberts&#8217; DDT as a springboard to rant about the STATE of selling in WWE, moreso that simple moves that used to be finishers are now ineffective. Heyman smartly turns it into pitching giving Mark Henry a headlock as a new finish, that is protected by how it&#8217;s sold/presented by commentators and keeping it up over 30 weeks. The way Heyman sold it sounded like it&#8217;d absolutely work. As long as he has to tell Orton he can&#8217;t use the headlock anymore!</p>
<p><strong>WWE&#8217;s Promos</strong><br>
Heyman recounts getting 4 minutes to close a WCW show putting everyone over, and forgetting to sell Starrcade; Dusty asked him &#8220;Where&#8217;s the Money?&#8221; i.e. his promo drew nothing since he forgot to mention Starrcade. So &#8220;what am I selling&#8221; is the basis of his promos, telling people who he is, why he&#8217;s here and what he is getting over, e.g. Lesnar defeating the Undertaker at WrestleMania. They don&#8217;t put any specific blame on anyone; Austin just offhand mentions a pet peeve of wrestlers talking when the mic isn&#8217;t up to their mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Vince McMahon Sr.</strong><br>
He recounts snapping a picture of Vince Sr. with Andre and making his first $50 in wrestling out of it. He absolves Vince Jr. of his ruthless territory-killing by postulating if Vince Sr. would&#8217;ve done it if he was in the position at the time. No, he wouldn&#8217;t have. Sure he was with the NWA until 1983.</p>
<p><strong>Heyman leaving WWE after December to Dismember</strong><br>
Says the fighting with McMahon over ECW got personal, also says he was burnt out.</p>
<p><strong>WCW Road stories</strong> ending in getting blacklisted from a rent-a-car in North Carolina.</p>
<p><strong>Heyman asks a few questions to Austin</strong><br>
<strong>Cena&#8217;s Springboard Stunner:</strong> He repeats what he&#8217;d already said; it doesn&#8217;t bother him, but since everyone kicks out of it, it&#8217;s ineffective and a wasted move.<br>
<strong>Wanna wrestle Brock at WM? :</strong> Feels very contrived, both go into shill mode about WrestleMania 32 in Cowboy Stadium and WWE flash a graphic up. WWE would want a big Texas star to get over 100,000 fans. Austin starts cutting an actual promo and pitches a Texas Death match. Disingenuous and awkward is a poor way to end the show.</p>
<p><strong>Overall: A non-confrontational, easy-going chat between two friends. It lost steam with Heyman&#8217;s rambling road stories but with two extremely engaging personalities, it&#8217;s enjoyable, but not a can&#8217;t-miss listen.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>If you wanna know more about Heyman&#8217;s final days in ECW (in 2006)</strong><br>
<em>Paul repeatedly told Vince all day long that &#8220;the people are going to throw this back in our face&#8221; with the horrific December to Dismember booking (RVD/CM Punk out first, Lashley winning). Vince stood his ground, let his vision pan out, and it did, and was universally hated, just as Paul predicted. The following day, Heyman was sent home, still under contract, given the boot from ECW Creative. Vince cited slumping TV ratings and a disgruntled talent roster as the cause i.e. he squarely placed the blame of Vince&#8217;s failure on Heyman.</em><br>
<em> Heyman would officially leave WWE a few months later, turning down Stephanie&#8217;s offer to go back to being head of Developmental creative. The one big positive of D2D being such a failure, it cancelled all future single-branded PPVs: All specials had all 3 rosters on it from then on. From then out, under Dave Lagana and then Dusty and the WWE braintrust, ECW meandered on until it was replaced with NXT (the talent show).</em></p>
