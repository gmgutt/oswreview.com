<p><strong>Cast:</strong> Directed by David Robert Mitchell, starring Maika Monroe as Jay (a girl&#8217;s name too, apparently).</p>
<p><strong>Plot:</strong> After having sex, Jay is now being followed by a murderous ghost. To stay alive she must evade the ghost, or pass it on to another by having sex.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts on the film:</strong><br>
• Yes, it&#8217;s SEX GHOST! A haunted STD&#8230;A Spectre-Transmitting Disease? That&#8217;s the best I got.<br>
• I love the 80s design of the poster. Nice one.<br>
• The acting is pretty ropey, the characters and dialogue aren&#8217;t very good but it is a hilarious &amp; interesting premise. A great scenario to discuss over a pint. As the movie progresses we find out the rules of this scenario, which is always good times.<br>
• So this ghost will follow you at a walking pace, and will kill you. You can delay that by having sex with someone else, and it&#8217;ll go after them instead. But when it kills them, it&#8217;ll go after you, and work it&#8217;s way back down the list.<br>
• A relentless killing, stalking being is like a slasher monster, but with a twist. I like it!<br>
• There is full-frontal nudity (both male and female) but it isn&#8217;t sexualised. The ghost happens to take the form of a middle-aged woman, and later a middle-aged man with his tadger hanging out. The main cast do have sex but it&#8217;s that fully clothed deal &#8211; with bra, panties and boxers on, and in almost silence, it&#8217;s quite impressive&#8230;<br>
• Perhaps it&#8217;s to take the sleezy aspect of &#8220;let&#8217;s bang to save my life&#8221;, the teens are quite young, and so are more reluctant to have sex (this wouldn&#8217;t be half as much a problem for college age or older).<br>
• Not much gore, the most gratuitous shot is at the end of the opening scene.<br>
• A lot of the fun of the movie is testing the boundaries of the scenario, and thinking of ways to beat the system: The guy that has sex with her was from another town and used a fake name. Creating distance is good, but it&#8217;d a lot smarter to go to Australia and do it! Or even better, bang a flight attendant, and the ghost will be on the ground walking back and forth, cursing the futility!<br>
• The ghost has a physical presence &#8211; it generally obeys the laws of physics (i.e. it will be stymied by a locked door and will break a window to enter a premises). Also, unless you&#8217;ve already been &#8216;marked&#8217;, you can&#8217;t see the ghost. It has mass &#8211; swing a chair at it will react to it. Shoot it in the head and it will drop momentarily. Perhaps trap the ghost in a room? Or in a car and lock the doors?<br>
• For better and worse, the kids are pretty dumb in the film. One of the kids aims at the invisible ghost, and shoots his friend instead. Christ!<br>
• There&#8217;s some cheap jump scares, such as a ball hitting a window, and a new one, plaster wall breaking inside a closet. Boo, this hurt the film.<br>
• A strong, informative start, where Jay is tied to a wheelchair (the camera is also attached to it, which is a fun way to shoot) and the premise is shown &amp; explained. Then the film slows down, and a kid looking like Emilio Estevez from the Breakfast Club befriends them and brings them to his dad&#8217;s cabin.<br>
• It makes sense that they wouldn&#8217;t initially believe her but her sister/friend actually laugh and dismiss her, despite her being terrified and crying. Some cheap writing in the film.<br>
• She sees guys on a boat; I loved that without hitting you over the head with it, they presented solutions (the guys, what about a boat).<br>
• Although silently stalking her, the ghost starts getting vindictive, throwing objects at Jay as it sees her plan &#8211; thought that was a bit out of character and a clichéd showdown thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, although it has stifled acting, boring characters and a coming-of-age pathos that just isn&#8217;t there, it&#8217;s a great idea, making it an enjoyable watch. Not a well-made film but it&#8217;s fun and engaging &#8211; give it a go and lemme know what you think!</strong></p>
